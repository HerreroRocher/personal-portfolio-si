          <p>
            Hi, I'm Daniel. I'm a passionate software engineer with experience in various technologies. I enjoy solving complex problems and building innovative solutions. In my free time, I like to learn new skills and work on personal projects.
          </p>

            A second‑year University of Manchester undergraduate with a passion for programming and 6 years of semi‑regular coding experience. I am enthusiastic about solving complex problems and am actively seeking a Software Engineer internship to apply my skills. My quick learning ability enables me to rapidly adapt to new technologies and contribute effectively to team projects. I am excited to start my career in computing and have a strong desire to demonstrate my skills in the industry.
